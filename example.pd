#X text 37 51 Rather than having one message which is parsed using
separators \, as in the previous example \, every toggle now has its
own message. If you start this Context \, you will see them cycle in
the message box. To edit the message \, click on a particular toggle
(whether its on or off) and then type into the messge box and press
enter. While the mouse is hovering over the Context canvas \, you can
also use the left \, right \, up and down keys to scroll through the
different message assignments. This should make things much easier!

#X text 40 196 The properties menu is relevant here. In the MESSAGES
section (top right) \, the "pattern" and "burst" options need to be
set to "multiple". They are set this way in this example \, but if
you create a new Context they will be "single" by default. This means
that each toggle will send the same message--a simpler setting. To
toggle between the two modes \, just click on the "multiple" button.
The "edit button next to it is also useful--you can edit all of the
messages at once there in a semi-colon separated list.;
#X text 39 324 One bug I know of: the last toggle (bottom right) doesn't
fire a message \, only a bang. I'll fix this soon. Other than that
\, I think it all works and saves properly \, but it won't be compatible
with the older examples that I sent. The messages won't load properly.
