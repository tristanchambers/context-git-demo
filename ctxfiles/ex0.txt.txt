No! As a sequencing tool, Context doesn't sound like anything. Context sends messages to other PD patches to tell them to do things, but the any sound design must happen outside of Context. Context can handle sample playback, but that's not going on here.;
In this case, the sound is a simple sine wave synth, generated within the patch called [glock~].;
The inlets (the tiny boxes at the top of each object) will start a Context, whenever a "bang" message is received. All inlets are the same. The outlets (boxes at the bottom) are synched with the sequencer, so each outlet will send a "bang" when it's the right time, indicated by the cursor that moves across the screen. Each outlet corresponds to one check-box (unfortunately, they don't quite line up). You can use the check-box to turn the outlet on or off.;
To make or destroy connections, you must be in edit mode. To enter edit mode, use the Edit menu, or press Ctrl+e. Once you see the hand cursor, you can make connections by clicking on an outlet box from one Context and draggin it to the inlet of another. The inlets are always at the top and the outlets are always at the bottom. This can be a bit tricky at first, but it's easy once you get used to it.;
The notes are being received by the object called "receive ex1-". This corresponds to the name on each Context canvas, "ex1". Different Contexts can have different names, but here they are the same so they are all going to the same place.;
This what the message boxes at the top are for. The | character is a separator, so 1|2|3|4 means "1 then 2 then 3 then 4". The square brackets prepend a symbol to each separated item, so [#]1|2|3|4 means "#1 then #2 then #3 then #4. Finally, the hash symbol indicates that this is a scaled note, so the number is sent to the [scaler] object for conversion (in this case to the D flat major blues scale);
Yes! That's what the number boxes in the top right corner are for. In this case, they measure seconds, so you can change the timing accordingly.;
