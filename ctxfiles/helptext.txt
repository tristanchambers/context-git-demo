1 RE-SIZING CONTEXT :: Hold down the Shift key and click + drag just outside of the Context you want to resize. The selectable area is exactly one toggle box outside of the Context abstraction. Use Control instead of Shift and the time duration will increase or decrease with the size.;
1 RE-SIZING MESSAGE BOX :: Hold down the shift key and click + drag just to on the right edge of the message box.;
1 TOGGLE FLOATS :: Double click + hold on any toggle and drag up or down. Positive toggle floats are virtual cable connections. Negative floats are interpreted my the send message (variable =).;
1 ZOOMING :: Hold down the Shift key and double click + drag just outside of the Context you want to resize. The selectable area is exactly one toggle box outside of the Context abstraction. Use Control instead of Shift and the time duration will increase or decrease with the size.;
1 SYMBOL SCROLLING :: Double click + hold on the message send (symbol box) and scroll up or down to increase or decrease a float in the send message. Double clicking will affect the first float in the message. Tripple clicking the second float etc.;

1 SAFETY :: By default a Context cannot have a cycle of less than 10 mili-seconds. This is to prevent stack overflows in case a Context is connected to itself or otherwise enters a feedback loop. But sometimes it is useful to have a Context with 0 time (ie. when using the burst as a logic gate.) In this case you can turn the "safety" setting off in the properties menu. But watch out for stack overflows!;

1 SWITCHING AXES :: Shift and double click on the number atom. This will switch the "burst" and "pattern" toggles between the X and Y axes.;
1 EDIT SEND MESSAGE :: Shift and double click on the symbol atom. You can then edit the send message and press Return when done.;
;
;
;
1 STARTING AND STOPPING :: Double click on the Context canvas to start it. Click and hold to stop. You can also send the messages "start" and "stop" to Context.;
1 USING MESSAGES :: You can start a Context with the message "start" ":s" or "bang" and stop it with the message "stop". Any received list starting with ! will also start a Context and be sasved for relative messaging (see MESSAGES -> RELATIVE MESSAGES);

1 PATTERN :: The pattern stores a basic rhythm which is played when the Context cycle starts. By default the X axis toggles form the pattern but it can be changed to the Y axis. The pattern toggles can also store and play back numbers (see MESSAGES -> VARIABLES -> =).;
1 BURST :: The burst stores toggles fire at the end of the Context cycle. They way in which they are selected can be determined by the burst settings. By default the Y axis toggles form the burst but this can be changed.;
1 SETTING TOGGLES :: All toggles can be set manually using the mouse or automatically using internal messages (see INTERNAL MESSAGES). Toggles can also store floats (see GUI MANIPULATION -> TOGGLE FLOATS). Positive floats are used to connect Contexts instead of "physical" connections and negative floats are used for message variables (see MESSAGES -> VARIABLES -> =);

0 WHICH VS. HOW MANY PROGRESSION RANDOMIZE WRAP PRESETS SAVE WHICH;
;
1 CABLE CONNECTIONS :: You can connect Contexts together to form networks using regular PD cable connections. The outlets are synched with the X axis toggles and will send a message at the right time. All inlets are identical. Inlets can be used to start a Context ("start" or "!" message) and to receive commands (see INTERNAL MESSAGES);
1 FLOAT CONNECTIONS :: A float connection is a "virtual" connection used in place of cable connections. It connects the toggle float (see GUI MANIPULATION -> USING TOGGLE FLOATS) with a Context ID number (see MORE -> ID). Float connections have three main avantages: 1. They are tidy. 2. They can be set using internal messages. 3. They do not register on the send messages.;
1 EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS :: All Contexts can send and receive messages through their ID numbers and tags (see MORE -> ID). Context number 3 will send sequenced messages to "c3-" and receive internal commands from "c3". Thus you can use regular send and receive objects to connect Context to other PD patches and objects.;
;
;
;
1 RECEIVING :: All Contexts receive messages through the receive channel "cx" where "x" is the Context ID number (see MORE -> ID). So if you send a message through object [send c13] it will be received by Context number 13. Received messages can either start a Context or be used for internal messaging (see INTERNAL MESSAGES).;
1 SENDING :: All Contexts send sequenced messages through the send chanel "cx-" where "x" is the Context ID number (see MORE -> ID). So you can receive the output of Context number 11 with the object [receive c11-];
1 TAGS :: You can assign additional send and receive channels using the tags (see MORE -> ID -> TAGS). Each tag creates one send and receive channel in the same way as the ID numbers. So a Context tagged "bass" will receive from [send bass] and send to [receive bass-].;
;
;
;
1 TIME CYCLE :: The number box on the top right determins the Context cycle and hence how long the pattern takes to play. It is measured in set in seconds. Negative numbers reverse the playback of the pattern. By default a Context cycle cannot be set to 0 seconds (see MORE -> SAFETY);
1 COEFFICIENT :: The coefficient sets a multiplier or divider on the duration specified in the number box. Use the coefficient number box to select the value and the box next to it to select the operation. IE: setting the coefficient to "60 * " will mean that the number box measures minutes. Setting it to "1 / " means that it measures fractions of a second ie. musical intervals.;

;
1 > :: This separator separates a message into three parts: patter burst and last. This means that the pattern can send different messages than the burst and last toggles. Ie. the message "a>b>c" would send "a" for the pattern "b" for the burst and "c" for the last toggle. If a section is left blank it is taken as "bang".;
1 | :: This separates a message into parts such that only one part will be send by one toggle. Ie. the message "a|b|c" might send "a" on the first pattern toggle "b" on the second and "c" on the third. The way in which the parts match the toggles is determined by the message settings.;
1 & :: This separates messages that will be sent in parallel by a single toggle. Ie. "a&b&c" will send three messages: "a" "b" and "c" when it is selected.;
;
;
;
0 ? [hash] < % ~ **;
0 @ ^ _ = ¬ **;
;
;
;
;
1 ARITHMETIC :: Any arithmetic expression written inside brackets in the message will be solved. For instance "(3*5)" will become "15" and "n((5+1)/2)" will become "n 3". Allowed operations are + - */ min max pow and mod. For more advanced mathematics you can uSe custom formulas (see MESSAGES -> VARIABLES -> WITH ARGUMENTS -> <).;
1 BRACKETS :: Anything inside brakets is interpreted as a mathematical expression. Non number characters are dropped. Anything outside brakets is treated as a character and will not be solved. You can use multiple levels of brakets but beyond 4 or 5 becomes quite CPU intensive.;
;
;
;
;
1 ` :: This character is replaced with a number from the last message that was sent by the same Context. Its argument is any character used to identify the variable. Ie. "n (`n+3)" yields "n 3" then "n 6" then "n 9"... every time it is sent. (The "n" inside the brakets is dropped so you need one outside the brakets as well.;
1 ! :: This character is replaced with a number from last message that Context received. Its argument is any character used to identify the variable. The received message must be preceded with ! if it is to be stored. Ie. "m (!m-1)" yields "m 5" if Context receives the messges "! m 6". Connected Contexts always send a ! message so this variable enables a Context network to pass numbers according to the input they receive.;
;
;
;
;
1 MESSAGE SETTINGS :: The message box can contain multiple messages ie. a a different note to be played on each toggle. The message settings are used to match a toggle firing event with a message section demarcated with the | separator (see MESSAGES -> SEPARATORS).;
1 LINEAR :: This setting cycles through the message sections in a circle. It will not reset when the Context cycle ends so the starting point will change each cycle if there is a different number ;

1 ID NUMBERS :: Each Context is assigned a unique ID number on creation. This is used for sending and receiving messages (see BASIC OPERATION -> RECEIVING MESSAGES). Generally it is a good idea to let Context keep track of its own ID numbers. However you can set them yourself in the properties menu. The "force" button allows two Contexts to possess the same ID number (not advised).;
1 TAGS :: You can assign a Context additional ID by giving it tags. Each tag creates a new end and receive channel for that Context (see BASIC OPERATION -> RECEIVING MESSAGES). A Context can have any number of tags and tags can be shared between Contexts. This is useful for creating groups ie. all Contexts with the tag "drums" will send their output to [receive drums-]. You can create and delete tags in the properties menu. Type it into the symbol box ad press Return to add. Type the name of an existing tag to delete.;
1 COLOURS :: You can set the color of a Context for keeping track of groups. Normal PD colour numbers are used: positives are presets and negatives are RGB.;

1 RELATIVE START :: You can start a Context at any point in its cycle using an argument for the "start" message ie. "start p 3" will start 3 beats into the cycle. The beat units are measured in toggles.;
1 RELATIVE STOP :: You can instruct a Context to stop before its cycle is complete using  a second argument for the "start" message. Ie. "start p 2 5" will start the Context and the 2nd and finish at the fifth pattern toggle. You can also reverse the pattern in this manner ie. "start 5 2".;
1 UNITS :: The default units for the relative start/stop messages are the position of the toggles. You can define it in seconds using the s prefix, ie. "start s 3.5 s 8" will start the Context at the 3.5 second position and finish at 8.;
;
;
1 CONDITIONAL START :: With conditional start a Context will only be allowed to start when the incoming start message meets a given condition. The condition is set in the GUI and matched by the arguments of the start argument. Ie. If the conditions are "2 3 4" the message "start 3" will start the Context but the message "start 5" won't. The Context can still be started manually by double clicking.;
1 SETTING :: To set the condition list you need to double click and hold the shift button twice. The first time you do this Context will enter "bank" mode. (Double clicking Shift will alternate between Bank and Condition mode). Then double click on an X axis toggle and scroll through the toggle floats. This way you can create a list of floats. When you let the Shift key go the list will disappear and you will enter "normal" mode again. Double shift click twice and you can re-edit the condition list.;
1 POSITIVE CONDITIONS :: Positive numbers define conditions that must be met for the Context to start. Ie. "start 2" will start the Context only if "2" is in the condition list.;
1 NEGATIVE CONDITIONS :: Negative numbers define conditions that must not be met. Ie. if the condition list is "-2 -3 -4" then the message "start 1" will start the Context but "start 2" will not. (The numbers are interpreted positively even though they are negative).;

1 WHICH VS. HOW MANY :: The burst settings are used to determine two variables: first HOW MANY toggles fire and then WHICH toggles fire. Both variables can be set manually in the number boxes or controlled systematically by the sliders.;
1 PROGRESSION :: This sets a linear progression to the number series so that a constant number is added each time the Context cycle ends (ie. +1 creates 1 2 3 4 ...). This can be used to determine WHICH toggles fire (ie. the first then the second...) or HOW MANY (ie. one then two...) The number series wraps back to 1 once it reaches its limit. Note that there is a difference between "+ 0" and "off". "off" fixes the middle point of the random variations while "+ 0" allows it to wander (the "drunken walk").;
1 RANDOMIZE :: This determines the degree of uncertainty in the toggle selection. The calculation is made according to Gaussian distribution with variable sigma (width). The far left represents sigma = 0 (definite) and the far right represents sigma = infinity (even distribution) with different degrees in between. The center point of the function is the last value to have been selected (unless the Progression is "off" in which case it is fixed).;
1 WRAP :: This determines whether the random variations wrap around the limit of the burst toggles. Suppose there were 4 toggles and the random function produces "5". The result would be "1" if wrap is on and "4" if it is off.;
1 PRESETS :: There are 3 presets for the burst settings: All (default) makes all burst toggles fire. Random makes one fire according to even distribution. Linear makes one fire according to a +1 linear progression.;
1 SAVE WHICH :: You can set which toggles fire in the "which" box by typing in a list of numbers (ie. "2 4 7"). Use the "save button" and these toggles will be remembered the next time Context is opened.;

1 RANDOM TIMING :: The time cycle can be randomized. One less than the last value entered into the number box is taken as the maximum range. Zero time cycle is allowed.;
1 RANDOM RESOLUTION :: This sets the allowed intervals for random timings in units of 1/x. 1 (default) means that only integers are allowed. 2 means that halves are allowed etc.;
;
;
;
;
1 POSITIONAL TIMING :: This mode allows the time cycle to be determined by the Context's position on the canvas. The distance is calculated radially from the Context with the previous ID number (if it also has positional timing turned on) or from the 0 point of the canvas.;
1 POSITIONAL RESOLUTION :: This sets the allowed intervals for positional timings in units of 1/x. 1 (default) means that only integers are allowed. 2 means that halves are allowed etc.;
1 POSITIONAL SCALE :: This sets how much the position of the Context affects the timing. The lower the number the more sensitive it is to dragging.;

1 ? :: Produces a random number. The argument is maximum ie. "?9" produces an integer from 0 to 9.;
1 # :: Produces a note on a defined scale. Must be used in conjunction with the [scaler] object (see MORE -> MORE -> OTHER OBJECTS -> SCALER).;
1 < :: This defines a custom operation on the argument. You can define the operation in the overlay (see OVERLAY). Use the last outlet from [olr] and inlet from [ols] to connect any arithmetic PD objects. Ie. "< 3" will give "-0.98" if you connect [cos] in the overlay.;
1 % :: This refers to another term previously defined in the same message. The argument is the term number. Ie. "10 20 30 % 2" will give "10 20 30 20" (20 being the second term). This is useful for calling the same random number twice.;
1 ~ (tilde) :: This takes a snapshot from a paired Content array (see MORE -> MORE -> OTHER OBJECTS -> CONTENT). The value will be the array value from wherever the cursor is when the message fires. The argument is the Content name. If left blank it will choose the first paired Content.;;
1 @ :: Produces a number defined by the position of the given Context on the canvas. This is defined by the same parameters as relative timing (see BASIC OPERATION -> TIMING ->POSITIONAL).;
1 ^ :: Produces the ID number of another Context. The argument is a tag used by a group of Contexts. Ie. "^drums" will yield the ID number of any one of the Contexts which is labelled "drums". This is used for directing internal messages to a particular group of Contexts (see INTERNAL MESSAGES).;
1 _ :: Produces the outlet number of the toggle that is firing the message. Ie. if toggles 2 and 5 are selected in the pattern it will yield "2" and then "5".;
1 = :: (This does not signify equals!) Produces the toggle float of the toggle that is firing the message. Note that only negative numbers work here although in order to distinguish this from float connect. Negative numbers are still interpreted as positive.;
1 ¬ :: Produces the distance between the toggle that is firing the current message and the next toggle. Ie. if toggles 1 2 4 7 are selected it will yield "1" "2" "3" "2" (assuming that there are only 8 toggles to choose from).;
